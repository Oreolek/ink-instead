# pink
An attempt to implement a subset of [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink) in lua using [lpeg](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg)

## How to use this to run a game
See the examples directory for a simple text based example and a LÖVE integration.

This is how to run the text-based example:

    $ lua examples/game.lua

And this example shows [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) integration:

    $ love examples/love2d

<!-- TODO: short example here -->
To use it in your project download the latest source or the latest [release](../../releases). You need just the [pink](../../tree/master/pink) directory.

## How to run tests
    $ lua test.lua
